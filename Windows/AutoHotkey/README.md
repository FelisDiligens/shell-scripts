# My AutoHotkey script

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This script requires AutoHotkey v2

The hotkeys are inspired by GNOME/Linux.

## Features

- `Ctrl`+`H` to toggle hidden files in Windows Explorer
- Middle mouse button to paste text in Windows Terminal
- `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`T` to open Windows Terminal (global or scoop version)
- `Super` to open Task View
- Double-press `Super` to open Start Menu
- Move cursor to the top left to open Task View.  
  Cursor has to move a certain speed (and in the top left direction) to prevent accidentally triggering the hot corner.  
  (Works with multiple monitors, too!)
- Use the scroll wheel in Task View to switch between Virtual Desktops.  
  (You may need to edit the script for that, depending on your system language)
- Disable dead keys (for backticks `` ` ``, circumflex `^`, etc.)  
  (You may need to edit the script for that, depending on your keyboard layout)
